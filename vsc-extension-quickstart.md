# Welcome to Auto Install Dependencies!

This is a VS Code extension that automatically checks your JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX files for imports and require statements. If a module is not found in your project, it will automatically run the appropriate package manager command (`npm install`, `yarn add`, or `pnpm add`) to install the package. It also verifies local file paths and offers auto correction of incorrect paths.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension.
2. Open a JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, or TSX file.
3. The extension will automatically check your files on save.

You can control the behavior of the extension with the following setting:

- `autoInstall.autoCorrectPaths`: enable or disable auto correction of incorrect local file paths.

## Next Steps

- Modify the settings to fit your needs.
- Check the README for more information.
- Report any issues or feature requests on the GitHub repository.

Happy coding!
